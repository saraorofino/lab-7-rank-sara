Hey Andrew - here we go again! Glad you're along for this journey with me. 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(tidyverse) 

kermit <- read_csv("kermit.csv")

```

Sara, I'm beginning to doubt your commitment to our code.
<<<<<<< HEAD
I'm not much of a commitment girl but for you Andrew I can make this thing work. 
=======

If you are the collaborator:
-load the tidyverse
-read in the kermit data as "kermit"
-make some side-by-side histograms of the Score.pre for all respondents, separated by the gender column.

```{r}

kermit_hist <- ggplot(kermit, aes(x = Score.pre))+
  geom_histogram(bins = 4)+
  facet_wrap(~Gender)

kermit_hist

```
